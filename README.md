## Introduction

It is now well acknowledged that the American political landscape is now more polarized, more divided, and more fractured than at any point since the US Civil War. 
Both political parties have grown ideologically extreme and homogeneous. At the heart of democratic politics is an 
implied trust in the process and institutions by which elections are administered. 
Yet, relatively little is known about support (or opposition) to behaviors meant to challenge the 
legitimacy of American elections, what we call "electoral contestation."  E

The $\texttt{electoralContestation}$ package is a collection of data, code, and documentation that accompanies the book, 
"Electoral Contestation and the Erosion of Democracy." The package is designed to be a comprehensive resource for those
who are interested in the study of electoral contestation.
