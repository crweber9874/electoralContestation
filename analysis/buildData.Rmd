If you set your own $\texttt{Sys.setenv("OPENAI_API_KEY" = "")$ you can use copilot's code completion. Otherwise, I just connect to the Dropbox folder on my computer, and read in the files, I then recode some common variables.

## AVP 2023, AVP Wave 1
## Sample Description 

**Sampling Frame**: Voters in the 2022 Election

YouGov recruited a representative sample of n=1000 Arizona resident adults to complete the survey. The respondents were matched to a sampling frame based on gender, age, race, and education. This sampling frame is intended to serve as a politically representative sample of Arizona registered voters, constructed from the American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata file, public voter file records, the 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration supplements, the 2020 National Election Pool (NEP) exit poll, and the 2020 CES surveys, including demographics and 2020 presidential vote.

```

Recode each data set with a minimal set of common demographic variables.

```{r}
original_columns <- names(avp23)
avp23 <- avp23 %>%
  # common variables
  mutate(black = ifelse(as.numeric(race) == 2, 1, 0),
         white = ifelse(as.numeric(race) == 1, 1, 0),
         latino = ifelse(as.numeric(race) == 3, 1, 0),
         asian = ifelse(as.numeric(race) == 4, 1, 0),
         american_indian = ifelse(as.numeric(race) == 5, 1, 0),
         age = 2022 - as.numeric(birthyr),
         married = ifelse(as.numeric(marstat) == 1, 1, 0),
         female = ifelse(as.numeric(gender) == 2, 1, 0),
         college = ifelse(as.numeric(educ) >= 5, 1, 0),
         faminc = ifelse(as.numeric(faminc_new) > 8, 1, 0),
         survey_weight = weight,
         county_fips = as.numeric(county_AZ),
         CD = as.numeric(cd),
         LD = as.numeric(LD_upper),
         zipcode = as.numeric(inputzip),
         caseidID = caseid, #By whatever is in the data,
         state = "4",
         year = 2023,
         survey = "avpw1",
         condition = "post"
         )
head(avp23)
```        

I created some functions in the package to avoid repetitive code -- particularly when recoding survey items that follow a common set of response categories.  These are in the $\texttt{/R}$ folder. Some are utilities and denoted $\texttt{util_}$. In any case, here's how I recoded the 2023 AVP data file.

## The 2024 AVP Data, Wave II (*n* = 803; *n$_{recontact}$* = 403)
### Description

**Sampling Frame**: Voters in the 2022 Election, including 403 recontacts from Wave I

YouGov interviewed 865 respondents and matched them down to a sample of 803 for the final dataset. Of these 803 respondents, 403 were recontacted from a previous study conducted between December 14, 2022, and December 28, 2022, AVP Wave 1. The remaining new respondents were matched to a sampling frame based on gender, age, race, and education. This sampling frame is intended to serve as a politically representative sample of Arizona registered voters, constructed from the American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata file, public voter file records, the 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration supplements, the 2020 National Election Pool (NEP) exit poll, and the 2020 CES surveys, including demographics and 2020 presidential vote.

The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity scores. A logistic regression was estimated for inclusion in the frame by combining the matched cases and the frame. The propensity score function included age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles of the estimated propensity score in the frame and post-stratified according to these deciles. The weights were then post-stratified based on the 2020 presidential vote choice and a four-way stratification of gender, age (4 categories), race (4 categories), and education (4 categories) to produce the final weight.

## Western States
## 2020

**Sampling Frame**: Voters across five western states, Latino oversample

YouGov interviewed 3577 respondents who were then matched down to a
sample of 3000 to produce the final dataset. An oversample of 600
Latinos were interviewed for a total of 3600. The respondents were
matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, and education. The
frame was constructed by stratified sampling from the full 2018 American
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year sample with selection within strata by weighted
sampling with replacements (using the person weights on the public use
file).

The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity
scores. The matched cases and the frame were combined and a logistic
regression was estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity
score function included age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education,
and region. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles of the
estimated propensity score in the frame and post-stratified according to
these deciles.

The weights were then post-stratified on 2016 Presidential vote choice, and
a four-way stratification of gender, age (4-categories), race (4-
categories), and education (4-categories), to produce the final weight.

The empirical design is a natural experiment; comparable numbers of participants 
complete pre or post election, or interregnum period. Five "core" items are present

$\bullet$ Attend march or demonstration
$\bullet$ Burn the American flag
$\bullet$ Contest the outcome in the courts
$\bullet$ Support ballot recounts
$\bullet$ Publicly criticize the integrity or fairness of the election

Two questions are experimentally varied.

$\bullet$ Attend march or demonstration [“even if turns violent”]
$\bullet$ Publicly criticize the integrity or fairness of the election ["on social media"]

Key findings: This is an interrupted design showing treatment effects within days of the election, large number of psychological measures, large number of trust/participation variables that can be used to distinguish contestation from related constructs

## Western States
## 2024

**Sampling Frame**: Voters across five western states, Latino oversample

YouGov interviewed 5082 respondents pre and post the 2024 election across the
states of Arizona (1286), Colorado (1187), Nevada (615), New Mexico (664), and
Utah (618), in addition to an oversample of 715 Hispanic respondents. 

The Hispanic oversample was matched down to 600 observations (300 before and after
the election), matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, and education.
The sampling frame is a politically representative "modeled frame" of Hispanic
US adults, based upon the American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata
file, public voter file records, the 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS)
Voting and Registration supplements, the 2020 National Election Pool (NEP) exit
poll, and the 2020 CES surveys, including demographics and 2020 presidential vote.
The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity scores.
The matched cases and the frame were combined and a logistic regression was
estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity score function included age,
gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and state. The propensity scores were
grouped into deciles of the estimated propensity score in the frame and
post-stratified according to these deciles.

The weights were then post-stratified on 2020 presidential vote choice as well
as a four-way stratification of gender, age (4-categories), race (4-categories),
and education (4-categories), to produce the Hispanic over sample weight.
We next proceeded to match down samples by state -- initially excluding the
Hispanic oversample results -- with 1100 for Arizona (550 before/after), 1000
for Colorado (500 before/after), 450 for Nevada (225 before/after), 400 for
New Mexico (200 before/after), and 450 for Utah (225 before/after). The respondents
were matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, and education by state.
The sampling frame is a politically representative "modeled frame" of US adults
within these states, based upon the American Community Survey (ACS) public use
microdata file, public voter file records, the 2020 Current Population Survey
(CPS) Voting and Registration supplements, the 2020 National Election Pool (NEP)
exit poll, and the 2020 CES surveys, including demographics and 2020 presidential
vote.

The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity scores.
The matched cases and the frame were combined and a logistic regression was
estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity score function included age,
gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and home ownership. The propensity
scores were grouped into deciles of the estimated propensity score in the frame
and post-stratified according to these deciles.
The weights were then post-stratified on 2020 presidential vote choice, 2024
presidential vote choice, as well as a four-way stratification of gender, age
(4-categories), race (4-categories), and education (4-categories), to produce
the initial weights by state.

Upon acquiring the initial weights by state, the respective Latino oversample
observations were added into their respective states. These aggregated state
frames were then post stratified by the Hispanic proportion of the population
within these states, as determined via the sampling frame to produce the final
weights by state.

Finally, all of the state observations were aggregated, with results weighted by
the proportion of the state's population within the sampling frame, to produce
a final single aggregated weight for the final 4000 observations.
